# Warm Up Class 38

For today's warm-up, we will be practicing the "Forward Backward Method" for developing algorithms. You can find the guide [here](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/challenges/code/forward_backward). Below are some excerpts from Solow's book, "How to Read and Do Proof's" which provides a mathematically rigorous explanation of the Forward Backward Method.

## The Backward Process - Solow

In the backward process you begin by asking, â€œHow can I conclude that the statement B is true? The question obtained from statement B in such problems is referred to here as the key question. Once you have posed the key question, the next step in the backward process is to provide an answer.

The process of asking the key question, providing an abstract answer, and then applying that answer to the specific problem constitutes one step of the backward process.

## The Forward Process - Solow

The forward process involves deriving from the statement A, which you assume is true, some other statement, A1, that you know is true as a result of A being true. Statements are directed toward linking up with the last statement obtained in the backward process.

## Instructions

Open a new doc. Follow the guide and fill in the intermediate steps for the following problems. The number of steps in the middle are up to you:

**Problem 1: Calculate the sum of all elements in a list**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-
-
-
- **B:** The sum of all numbers in the list is 15

**Problem 2: Determine if a word is a palindrome**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A string "radar"
-
-
-
- **B:** The string "radar" is a palindrome (True)

**Problem 3: Find the maximum number in a list**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-
-
-
- **B:** The maximum number in the list is 5
